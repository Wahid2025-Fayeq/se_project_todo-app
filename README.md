# Simple Todo App
This project is a dynamic Todo List application that allows users to create, view, and manage tasks with due dates. Users can add new todos through a popup form, which includes real-time form validation. Each task is assigned a unique ID and displayed instantly in the list.

The project is built using JavaScript classes and modules, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to keep the code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain.
